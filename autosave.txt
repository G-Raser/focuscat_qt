FocusCat is a tiny writing companion (version 1.3.2) that sits quietly on your screen... or not so quietly if you keep poking it (ฅ'ω'ฅ).  
It meows, blinks, and sometimes refuses to cooperate — especially when deadlines are near.  
People say, “Cats can’t help you focus,” but maybe this one does. Maybe.  

Remember to save your work (Ctrl+S, not “cat+S”) — otherwise, the cat might pretend it didn’t see your progress.  
Numbers like 3.14159 or dates like 31/10/2025 shouldn’t break sentence coloring, right? Right!  

Now let’s try some abbreviations: e.g., i.e., etc., Mr. Whiskers Jr. should all stay within one color group.  
Also test punctuation — question marks? exclamation marks! ellipses… and parentheses (like this one).  
Quotes might be tricky: “Sometimes I nap for productivity,” said the cat.  
Don’t forget nested brackets ((this is inside that) which is inside this).  

中文测试部分开始：这是一只可爱的猫猫，它喜欢打断你的思路。  
“喵——”它说道，“快来陪我玩！”  
当句子中夹杂英文时（例如 FocusCat、Python、GUI 等词），颜色是否还能保持？  
最后一行包含各种符号测试：★☆♡！？？～……（￣▽￣）ノシ 结束。
