The second one is non-human resources (Both physical and technological) which includes all the needed infrastructure, both physical and technological for delivery. This could be cloud solutions and secured data-storing and establishing protective spaces, collaborative applications like Jira, Confluence or Slack that provide remote collaboration, or specific environments for testing the pre-launch operation. As a matter of fact too, the management of resources is essenti al not only for the deve lopment phase, but also for system validation and pilot execution or final delivery. The combined management of human and non-human resources is a key to project success, and its coordination extends throughout the life cycle of the project life (Kerzner, 2022).
Non-humain resources: Non-human resources are created by Cloud development environments (AWS or Azure) self-organized by September 2025 for hosting system development, testing and production. We will use collaboration software such as Jira, Confluence, Slack, for communications and tracking of progress. Security compliance tools (e.g., penetration testing and encryption/decryption), libraries for access control, among others are the reasonable necessity that need to be done before the security and privacy review process of November 2025. On the other hand, a pre release environment that mimics real processes can be used for end-to-end testing in controlled conditions. We will develop training materials (e.g., user manuals, onboarding videos and FAQs) to educate coordinators and employers about the pilot projects.
